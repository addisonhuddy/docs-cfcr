This is the documentation for Cloud Foundry Container Runtime (CFCR), an open-source project that provides a solution for deploying and managing [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) clusters using [BOSH](https://bosh.io/docs).

CFCR uses BOSH to improve the Kubernetes experience for both operators and developers. By leveraging BOSH, CFCR adds capabilities such as high availability, scaling, and self-healing to Kubernetes clusters.

CFCR was formerly known as Kubo, and many CFCR assets still use the Kubo name. CFCR does not require Cloud Foundry, but you can optionally configure a Cloud Foundry deployment to handle routing for CFCR.

See [What is CFCR?](./overview/what-is-cfcr/) to learn more.

## Installing and Configuring

To deploy CFCR, you must first deploy and configure BOSH.
You can deploy BOSH using the BOSH Bootloader (`bbl`) command-line utility.
After configuring BOSH, you can deploy the CFCR BOSH release.

Follow the steps below:

1. Deploy BOSH using `bbl`. See the [BOSH Bootloader repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader) for instructions.
1. Deploy the CFCR BOSH release. See the [CFCR repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release) for instructions.

To delete CFCR, see [Deleting CFCR](./overview/deleting/).
